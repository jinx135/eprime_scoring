Hello ya'll.

DEPENDENCY INFORMATION:

The script requires python3.6 or greater in order to run, and also uses the pandas
module in order to quickly manipulate the data.

To get the most up to date version of python, please visit:

https://www.python.org/

To check if your machine currently has "pandas". In the command prompt type:

"python3" and press enter.

You are now in the python shell. Once you are inside the python shell type:

"import pandas"

You get back a blank prompt this means that pandas is installed. If you get an error,
you will need to install pandas. You can do this by exiting the python shell by typing:

"exit()" or "quit()" into the command line and pressing enter.

INSTALLING PANDAS:

To install pandas on a mac.os device. Type:

"pip3 install pandas" into the command prompt and press enter.

If there is an error in getting the package you will need to use the sudo command.

"sudo pip3 install pandas".

NOTE: Use of the sudo command requires the admin password for the machine.

RUNNING THE SCRIPT:

To run this script, (it will currently only work on mac.os devices because of the way
file structures are named) type the command:

"python3 main.py" into the terminal command line and press enter.

The on screen prompts should tell you the rest of the information you need to know.
If they don't - report an error on github or shoot me an email.
